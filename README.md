## distribute tasks among members

# NOTE: no working on main branch eg: routes/teamMember

### Your app must:

- Use Express as a foundation.

- Use Mongoose for models and database communication.

- Have 2 models or more. Having one for users is a no-brainer. The other one(s) should represent the main functionality of your app. Don’t force it if having more than two models doesn’t make sense.

- Have validation on the models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.

- Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (and/or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).

- Implement all CRUD actions on models other than users. You should have the Create, Read, Update and Delete features even if they aren’t all for the same model.
- Have a repo on GitHub.
- Have at least 1 commit per day/person.
- Be deployed online using a free deploy service so that anybody could use your app.
- Responsive design.

# Deliverables
- A working full-stack application, built by you that runs on a server.
- A working app deployed.
- The URL of the GitHub repository for your app.
- The URL of the live app on the Internet.
- The URL of the slides for your app’s presentation.
- You must present your app during Project #2 final presentations (last day of Project #2 time).
